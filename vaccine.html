 <h1 class="vas">VACCINATION</h1>
 <p class="va">Vaccination  trains your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it's exposed to a disease. However, because vaccine contains only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.</p> 
 <h1 class="im">IMPORTANT OF VACCINATIONS</h1>
 <p class="vass">Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from disease. its much safer for your immune system to learn this through vaccination than by catching the disease and treating them. once your immune system knows how to fight a disease, it can often give you long protection.</p>
