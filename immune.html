 <p class="im">The immune system is a complex network of organs, cells, and proteins that defends the body against infections, whilst protecting the body's own cell.<br>The immune system keeps the body a record of every germs (microbe) it has ever defeated so it can recognise and destroy the micrebe quickly if it enter the body again. </p>
 <h1 class="imt">WHAT ARE THE THREE TYPES OF IMMUNE SYSTEM?</h1>
 <p class="immo">This protection is called immunity:<br>
Humans have three types of immunity.<br>
1.innate.<br>
2.adaptive.<br>
3.passive.<br>
The main job of the innate immune system is to fight harmful substance and germs that enter the body, for instance through the skin or digestive system.<br>
